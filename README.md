# EVA

The idea behind this project is to make a serverless telegram bot (make it as cheap as possible ðŸ’¸) using Google Cloud Functions, Firebase and a small cron running on Google App Engine, to notify me about some useful stuff in a kind of smart way.

### Install

To use this in your own project you should create a Google Project on Firebase and deploy the code on this repo following [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started).

You must also set your bot's `API KEY` running:

```
firebase functions:config:set telegram.bot_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Finally, you have to set your bot's webhook to the URL returned by the deploy. Using [HTTPIE](https://httpie.org/) it would be something like this:

```
http POST "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_API/setWebhook" url="https://us-central1-YOUR_GOOGLE_APP_ID.cloudfunctions.net/evaBot?token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Note: `YOUR_TOKEN` is a token generated by you :) to identify the origin of the request.
